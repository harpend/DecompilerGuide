    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This project has been created to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for those that are interested in building decompilers. This guide is meant to provide an overview which is applicable to any target language. I am not an expert, and will make plenty of mistakes, therfore please feel free to submit reccomendations/changes via issues on the github page.</p>

    <p>This is far from complete, however I'm hoping that sharing throughout the process of building it will result in a better end product.</p>
