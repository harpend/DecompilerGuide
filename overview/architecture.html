                <h2>Decompiler Architecture</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The phases of a decompiler are structured in a similar way to compilers, this is because they are performing the similar task of translating from one language to another. When translating code from one language to another we store it as an intermediate representation. The intermediate representation can come in many forms such as graphs or trees. The goal is to use the phases of a decompiler to get it closer and closer to the source code.</p>
                <p>Here is a diagram of the phases:</p>
                Disassembly--IR-->CFG Generation--CFG-->DFA--exprs-->CFG Analysis--statements-->Code Gen.
                <!--Insert diagram-->
                <h3>Disassembling</h3>
                <p>Disassembling takes our machine code and translates it to assembly, this is considered a 1 to 1 mapping. It is not as straightforward as it sounds due to code and data not being separated in binary code. There are 2 main approaches to separating code from data: Linear Sweep and Recursive Descent.</p>
                <p>Linear Sweep works by reading the binary file sequentially. This can lead to misinterpretations between data and code. On the plus side, it is fast and simple to implement.</p>
                <p>Recursive Descent works by starting at the entry point of the program and following the flow of instructions. This means that if a jump instruction occurs, then it will follow this new path until it reaches another change in control flow. This technique is much more robust and accurate for diassembling programs.</p>
                <h3>Control Flow Graph Generation</h3>
                <p>Control flow graphs are a representation of how the control flow of a program looks. The nodes of the graph contain instructions that execute one after another (the nodes are called basic blocks). There are a set of instructions that terminate a basic block e.g. returns or jumps. Jumps indicate an edge from one basic block to another.</p>
                <p>Some edges are implicit, this occurs in 2 scenarios. The first scenario is when we encounter a conditional jump, which if the conditional is not statisfied the execution of the program continues to the next sequentially located instruction. The second scenario is when an edge enters inbetween instructions of a basic block, this causes us to split the basic block into 2 and then add an edge between the 2 new basic blocks.</p>
                <p>Here are diagrams:</p>
                <!--Insert diagrams-->
                <h3>Data Flow Analysis</h3>
                <p>Data Flow Analysis uses the graph we have previously generated to calculate expressions in the code. This can involve removing instructions that cannot be executed or detecting idioms in the code. Here is a visualisation of that process:</p>
                <!--Insert diagram-->
                <p>An important technique used within data flow analysis is SSA (Static Single Assignment). SSA is a process where we represent each individual register allocation as a new variable. This makes it much easier to determine what values are available in each basic block and to determine expressions.</p>
                <h3>Control Flow Graph Analysis</h3>
                <p>Control Flow Analysis is a technique to detect different structures (statements) in the control flow graph. These can be if-then-else or loops and is where much of the research on decompilers has been focussed. Many of the challenges come from unstructured code i.e. those with gotos. This occurs in C, but can also occur in Java since you can break to labels.</p>
                <p>Obfuscators often work by targetting this weakness of decompilers by trying to make code as unstructured as possible. Decompilers can tackle this by detecting the use of obfuscators and attempt to reverse some of the obfuscation. Obfuscation is very common in Java programs, this is due to the simplicity of Java decompilation.</p>

                <h3>Code Generation</h3>
                <p>Code Generation is exactly what it sounds like, we take the statements and expressions generated from previous phases of the decompiler and transform them into their written counterparts. Expressions and statements should be represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) similar to what a compiler would use for the program of your choice. Code is outputed by traversing this tree and creating the output the user of the decompiler sees.</p>
