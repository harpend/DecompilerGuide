                <h2>Building a Bytecode Disassembler</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In this article I will refer to Java/Java bytecode and C#/CIL for examples, however I will aim to keep it applicable to any language.</p>
                <p>Bytecode has the useful property of being stored sequentially and separated from data. Furthermore, It is typically stored as an attribute of a method which allowing us to more easily segregate code into functions. Throughout this article it is useful to refer to specifications given by the language you wish to disassemble:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html">Java Class File Specification</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://essentialcsharp.com/home">Essential C# (Ch24)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/#:~:text=This%20Standard%20defines%20the%20Common,unique%20characteristics%20of%20those%20environments.">C# CLI Specification</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Any language that compiles to bytecode usually stores metadata within their chosen file format. This allows reference to this metadeta by the instructions. The metadata contains a set of constants that the instructions refer to allowing the runtime to execute the commands correctly and to determine libraries or other dependencies needed.</p>
                
                <p>The content/format of this metadeta can vary, for example Java stores it's metadata (along with the bytecode) in a .Class file, there is one .Class file for each class. In contrast, C# stores it's metadata (and bytecode) within typically 1 executable file. Therefore, it is very important to get familiar with the structure of the file containing your bytecode.</p>
                <!--Insert images of file structure for class file and CLI-->
                <p>Once you are familiar your next step is to build a parser. The parser will read the file and extract it's information into a set of data structures easily accesable by the decompiler. The data structures you use should vary on the section of data, for example the constant pool in Java represents a tree like strucure with each constant containing various fields potentially linking to other constant pool values.</p>
                <p>The other major consideration is the storage of your instructions. Since both C# and Java are stack based, they implicitly reference values on the stack. In stack-based code the number of operands can vary significantly based on the instruction (sometimes one instruction can also have varying field sizes). This means you should store instructions adaptively based on the correct number of fields.</p>
                <p>You can now choose to output the disassembled code, or pass the relevent information to the decompiler. Building a dissasembler is a great way to understand the low level of the language you are working with, and due to extensive documentation for bytecode languages such as C# and Java, it should be relatively straightforward.</p>
